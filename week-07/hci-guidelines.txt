# Production Problem 5: Implementing HCI guidelines for touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, Android, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment.

You only need to sketch your redesign, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/
* Android Design Guidelines:
  http://developer.android.com/design/index.html
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:

## Deliverables

Fine-grained, atomic commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guidline One (URL): Defer to Content (https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH66-SW2)
* How you implemented it in your sketch: One of the methods to "defer to content" is "Reconsider
  visual indicators of physicality and realism." For my design I implemented this by not giving the
  login button any shadow, or any other element. The entire design is very flat and simple, putting
  emphasis on the content of the login form instead of any individual interactive element.

* HCI Guidline Two (URL): Provide Clarity (https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH66-SW3)
* How you implemented it in your sketch: The simplicity of the design lends itself to being clear. I
  made use of the recommendation "Use plenty of negative space." by spacing out the two input fields
  (so they can be easily tapped by large fingers), as well as placing the forgot password link
  opposite the login link (making it harder to accidentally click). For "Ensure legibility by using
  the system font." I made all text Helvetica, and avoided unnecessary bolding when possible.

* HCI Guidline Three (URL): Use Depth to Communicate (https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH66-SW4)
* How you implemented it in your sketch: I conveyed hierarchy in this design through the order the
  elements were placed on the screen. The most important part is the page title, followed by a logo
  to make it more official and recognizable. Next, the header and input fields, always placing
  labels above or equal to the interactive elements. Finally, the search box was placed at the
  bottom due to it being the least important of all elements. If a user interacted with the search
  box, it could expand upwards to show search results (as a layer above the regular page).
