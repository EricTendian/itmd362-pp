# Production Problem 4: Color Palettes for HCI

## The Problem

Using either Adobe Color CC (https://color.adobe.com/), Paletton (http://paletton.com/), or another
Web-based palette generator of your choosing, you will create a number of different color palettes,
based on the requirements in the Deliverables section below.

## Deliverables

Fine-grained, atomic commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) screenshots of your web-based palette for the four palettes below;
2) an explanation, after each palette request below, why you chose the colors you did

* A monochromatic palette for a website that creates high-end, custom-made gaming laptops.

Filename: monochrome.png
Explanation of your color choices: Gaming and high-tech themes often include green text on a black
background, which I wanted to come out in my color choices. The website would use the lighter greens
for more eye-catching text and the very dark greens and black for backgrounds. I aim to give a
hacker-esque feel with these colors.

* A shaded color palette for a website that sells natural and organic foods.

Filename: shaded.png
Explanation of your color choices: The words "natural" and "organic" make me think of the earth and
various earthy colors like browns, greens, and yellows. I chose different shades of yellow for this
palette, leaning more towards a darker yellow that has hints of green, making it a color of brown
soil or yellow produce. The middle shade of yellow is bright to indicate freshness, important for food.

* A complementary palette for a banking website.

Filename: complementary.png
Explanation of your color choices: When I think of a banking website, I imagine subdued colors, mostly
greyscale with a hint of blue, green, or red. In this case I chose to go with a light blue, which
is a fairly neutral yet pleasant color that can pop out in certain uses. The blues were augmented
with a light and dark grey, used for a background, button, or text.

* A triadic palette for a website that offers games for children.

Filename: triadic.png
Explanation of your color choices: Children often enjoy bright, eye-catching colors, which is what I
tried to make use of with this palette. The different shades of blue can be used for buttons, and the
red or yellow can enhance a page heading. Black should be used as either a background or text color.
While not included in the palette, white is a good alternative or pairing to black text, especially
on colored backgrounds.
