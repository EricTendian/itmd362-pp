# Production Problem 8: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that objectâ€™s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the week-13/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral: The radio is boxy but has smooth curves and lines. It has a plain black color, making it look unassuming and professional.

* Behavioral: Textured surfaces are a prominent feature on the radio, such as the bumps on the side buttons and knobs. The large vertical bumps on the knob make it easy to turn with gloves on.

* Reflective: The familiar shape of the radio, plus the logo on the front, makes its purpose clear as a professional two-way radio.

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 3/MyIIT redesign:

1. Ergonomic - The object adapts to the user, rather than the user trying to adapt to the object.
2. Recognizable - The object's design is familiar to what we have seen before and follows conventions.
3. Authoritative - When looking at the object for the first time, it looks professional and able to get the job done well.
